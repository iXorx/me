      <p>
        Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.

        There are many things you can do to make your site more accessible. This includes:

        <li>Providing good keyboard navigation</li>
        <li>Providing good focus indicators</li>
        <li>Using ARIA roles and properties</li>
        <li>Ensuring your site works with screen readers</li>
        <li>Testing with real users</li>
      </ul>
